.SH NAME
pass-tomb \- A \fBpass\fP(1) extension that helps to keep the whole tree of
password encrypted inside a \fBtomb\fP(1).

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpass tomb\fP [args] gpgid...
.br
\fBpass open \fP [args]
.br
\fBpass close\fP [args]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Due to the structure of \fBpass\fP(1), file- and directory names are not encrypted
in the password store. \fBpass tomb\fP provides a convenient solution to put your
password store in a \fBtomb\fP(1) and then keep your password tree encrypted
when you are not using it.

It uses the same GPG key to encrypt passwords and tomb, therefore you don't need
to manage more key or secret. Moreover, you can ask pass-tomb to automatically
close your store after a given time.

.TP
.B The new workflow is the following:
.IP
1. Create a password tomb with \fBpass tomb\fP. It creates a new tomb and opens it
in ~/.password-store. Then it initialises the password repository with the same
GPG key.
.IP
2. Use tomb as usual.
.IP
3. When finished close the password tomb: \fBpass close\fP.
.IP
4. To use pass again, you need to open the password tomb: \fBpass open\fP.


.SH COMMAND

.TP
\fBpass tomb\fP [ \fI--no-init\fP, \fI-n\fP ] [\fI--timer=time\fP, \fI-t time\fP]
   [ \fI--path=subfolder\fP, \fI-p subfolder\fP ] [\fI--force\fP, \fI-f\fP] \fIgpg-id...\fP

Create and initialise a new password tomb. This command must be run first,
before a password store can be used.

Use
.I gpg-id
for encryption of both passwords and tomb. Multiple gpg-ids may be specified,
in order to encrypt the tomb and each password with multiple ids.

If \fI--path\fP or \fI-p\fP is specified, along with an argument,
a specific password tomb using gpg-id or a set of gpg-ids is assigned for that
specific subfolder of the password store.

If \fI--no-init\fP, \fI-n\fP is specified, do not initialise the password store.
By default, pass-tomb initialises the password store with the same key(s) it
generated the tomb. The purpose of this option is to let the user free to
initialise the password store with a different key or set of keys.

If \fI--timer\fP, \fI-t\fP is specified, along with an argument, the password
store will be automatically closed using a systemd timer after a given time. This
time will be saved in the .timer file present in the store.

If \fI--force\fP is specified, the password store will create or mount the
password store even if a plain text swap is present. Make sure you know what you
are doing if you force an operation.

.TP
\fBpass open\fP [\fI--timer=time\fP, \fI-t time\fP] [\fI--force\fP, \fI-f\fP] [\fIsubfolder\fP]
Open a password tomb. If a .timer file is present in the store, a systemd timer
will be initialized.

If \fI--timer\fP, \fI-t\fP is specified, along with an argument, the password
store will be automatically closed using a systemd timer after a given time.
If a '.time' file was already present in the store, this time will be updated.
Multiple timer can be used in the same time.

If \fI--force\fP is specified, the password store will create or mount the
password store even if a plain text swap is present. Make sure you know what you
are doing if you force an operation.

If \fIsubfolder\fP is specified, the password store will be opened in the subfolder.

.TP
\fBpass close\fP [\fIstore\fP]
Close a password tomb.

If \fIstore\fP is specified, pass close will try to close this store.
